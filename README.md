## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions  

### "Can I import existing dialogs?"  
**YES!** Paste your dialog code (even full config files) ‚Üí Select target class ‚Üí Start editing immediately.

### "Why does text look different in-game?"  
Editor uses similar, but not exactly the same fonts for text rendering. Arma doesn't use regular font types

### "My dialog fails to import!"  
This app uses custom C++ parser, specifically crafted for dialogs config. If you are sure your dialog works fine in-game, then report dialog code 

### "Game crashes with exported dialog!"  
Report dialog code

### "Does this work for other Arma games?"  
*Technically it should* for config structure, but visual rendering may differ. This web editor can also be tuned to support other games
